# HW
## TODO
3. ICSP backwards ( but labels match layout
4. OSH park logo backwards
8. Keepout inside hearts on the SAO pins is too small, but noone should be soldering on front so IDK
9. Need to tent vias.
## DONE
1. USB ID should float.
2. U1 pin 1 not marked on PCB
5. Battery terminals backwards. Gnd in middle, vcc on sides.
6. Ring around LED shorting Row1 and Row2
* All of Layout
  * Part placement
  * add traces
  * add lanyard PTH
* AVR ISP Header footprint
* Assign footprints
* Verify AVR footprint
* Modify SAO footprint to be press-fit
* Battery holder footprint
* Pullin footprints for passives
* Find Resistors and Capacitors
* Schematic  
* MCU and battery holder part choices

# FW
## TODO  
* Fork arduinocore and micronucleus to make an all in one board support package for arduino.
Already fixed bootloader. Hold S2 to start bootloader, otherwise it goes straight to sketch.
* Setup Arduino for MCU
* Port charlieplex code
* Implement RGB PWM
* Implement I2C
* Get both charlieplexed and RGB LEDs to look good

## DONE  
* Charlieplex code from previous project

# ART
## TODO 
* Fix Rain
* Fix Sassquach
 
## DONE 
* Place marker for SAO
* Place icon art
* Figure out art placement
* Place marker for lanyard holes
* Find new art
* Resize BSides logo and center
* Art from previous project
* BSides Logo Vecotrized
* Layered project file
